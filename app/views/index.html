    <p>This site hosts prototypes related to equality action plans.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Full journey</h2>

    <p>
      These are end-to-end journeys of the full action plan process rather than
      visualisations of individual features.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Action plans - implementation</h2>

    <p>
      These are visualisations of concepts and ideas around action plans. The
      visualisations in this section are largely in line with proposals so far
      and therefore are likely to be a good basis for implementation.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Action plans - exploratory</h2>

    <p>
      These visualisations are for concepts that are not yet in the proposals
      but they may be useful for supporting user research and policy discussion
      around these concepts.

    <p>
      These visualisations are old explorations that are no longer likely to be
      implemented - kept only as a record to refer back to.

      While the above journeys may evolve and iterate,
      these journeys are "snapshots" used for user research.
