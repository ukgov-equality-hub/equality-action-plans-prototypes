      <p>
        From April 2027, organisations with over 250 employees must submit an action
        plan with their gender pay gap report. This plan must show how you
        intend to address your gender pay gap, and to support employees going
        through the menopause. In future years, you will review your existing
        plan rather than creating a brand new one.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must choose from our list of actions, all of which are backed by
        evidence that demonstrates their effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        This service will guide you through the process of choosing actions for
        your plan.
