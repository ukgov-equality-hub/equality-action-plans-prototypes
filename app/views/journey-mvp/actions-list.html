      <p>
        For each action, we will ask if you:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>plan to start doing it in the next reporting year</li>
        <li>are already doing it, but will be actively working to improve it in the next reporting year</li>
      </ul>
     
      <p>
        You can also let us know if you do not want to include actions. This could be because your organisation:
      </p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>will not be working on them in the next reporting year</li>
        <li>is already doing them and will not be working to improve them in the next reporting year</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You will be able to review and edit your full action plan before you submit it.
