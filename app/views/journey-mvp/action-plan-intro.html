        Gender pay gap action plans
      </h1>

      <p>
        From 2027, organisations with over 250 employees must submit an action
        plan with their gender pay gap report. This plan must show how you
        will:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>address your gender pay gap</li>
        <li>support employees going through the menopause</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>
        You must choose from our list of actions. These are backed by evidence 
        which demonstrates their effectiveness. The actions cover the following 
        categories:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>analysing your data</li>
        <li>recruiting staff</li>
        <li>building diversity into your organisation</li>
        <li>promoting and retaining staff</li>
        <li>supporting staff during menopause</li>
        <li>creating a more flexible workplace</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In future years, you will review your existing plan rather than 
        creating a brand new one.
      </p>

      <p>
        This service will guide you through the process of choosing actions for
        your plan.
      </p>
