{% set actionPlanExplanation %}
  <p>
    Any employer who has a headcount of 250 or more on their ‘snapshot date’ at
    the end of the financial year must submit an action plan outlining how they
    intend to address the gender pay gap and to support employees going through
    menopause.
  </p>
  <p>
    Employers review actions from our database, identify any they already routinely
    do, and choose some new actions to focus on. You can also
    <a href="#">see the full list of actions in our database</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more detail on the process, see the
    <a href="#">gender pay gap and action plan guidance</a>.

      <p>Following the 2024 Pay Gap figures, significant action is required to reduce the gap and achieve better gender balance at every level. Our plan to accomplish this will be built on key principles: fair and transparent employment and pay practices for everyone; evidence-based and collaborative solutions that are sustainable; and consistent tracking and reporting of progress to both the board and employeess twice a year.</p>
